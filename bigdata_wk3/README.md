## How to use LTI interface

While completing the programming assignment, you have to submit your assignment. In order to make submission, you have to create a notebook. When you created a Jupyter notebook, in the right top corner you could see a dropdown with tasks and a button "Submit assignment". You have to choose the appropriate task (the task that you have chosen from Coursera Interface) and press the blue button. 

After that you will see a popup window with notification that your task have submitted. 

In some minutes you will get a popup window with submission status: your grade and results from the grading system server.
